## Researching Commands
Here are 4 interesting ways I found to use the `grep` command, along with 2 examples for each of the 4 new options. 

### Coloring `grep` results using the `--color` option. 
2 examples of using this with the `written_2` files with a screenshot of each output:
```
$ grep --color "Lucayans" written_2/travel_guides/*/*.txt
```

```
$ grep --color "art museums" written_2/travel_guides/*/*.txt
```

This alternate way of using `grep` colors the search string or pattern that you are trying to find with `grep`. This option can make it easier to locate the search string or pattern if the output is a sea of results.

### We can use the `-r` option to search for a pattern in all files in a directory and its subdirectories
2 examples of using this with the `written_2` files with a screenshot of each output:
```
$ grep  -r "cafÃ©" written_2 > results.txt
```

$ grep -r "exotic birds" written_2

This addition to the `grep` command is an easier way to search for a string or pattern through a directory and its subdirectories, without having to know any names of the directory's subdirectories. Say I wanted to search through a directory for a specific string, but I know nothing of any subdirectories. The `grep -r` command would come in handy.
