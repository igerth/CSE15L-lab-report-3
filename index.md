# Lab Report 3

## Researching Commands
Here are 4 interesting ways I found to use the `grep` command different from what we have done in lab. 

### Coloring `grep` results using the `--color` option. 
You can use this option to make your results stand out from the rest your text. Example of using this with the `written_2` data with a screenshot of its output:
```
grep --color "Lucayans" written_2/travel_guides/*/*.txt
```
