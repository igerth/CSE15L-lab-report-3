## Researching Commands
Here are 4 interesting ways I found to use the `grep` command, along with 2 examples for each of the 4 new options. 

### Coloring `grep` results using the `--color` option. 
2 examples of using this with the `written_2` files with a screenshot of each output:
```
grep --color "Lucayans" written_2/travel_guides/*/*.txt
```
